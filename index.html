      <p>
        Alan Titchmarsh is one of Britain's best-loved gardeners, writers and television presenters. He started his gardening career at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew before moving into gardening journalism in the 1970s, and has been a regular fixture in print, on our screens and on the airwaves ever since.

        Alan is a regular contributor to the gardening section of Country Life, writing a monthly article covering everything from his favourite plants to details about the gardens at his homes in Hampshire and on the Isle of Wight.

      <p>Plant perennials in groups so that they have more impact. Plant them in threes or fives of the same plant. If you plant lots of single plants then the border can end up looking a bit ‘spotty’.</p>
